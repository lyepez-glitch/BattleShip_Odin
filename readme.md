for each length of a ship make a space for each one


display each ship on the side starting blue and make each cell shot red
when a ship sinks say you sunk my battleship


make computer go two or three times every time so you can test if player 2 wins


in manage turn if ship is sunk meaning all five pieces or however many then the score of player says you sank my battleship

the random generation of computer for a ship find a random spot put a piece in the same column but row below put a piece to the right a piece to the left if there is a row above then put in that row
for player one the same except it finds the piece it was clickedon
every time a click is counted then that is how many numbers to place around it
